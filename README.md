I've had a lot of fun during this project. I'm currently studying HTML, CSS, & JS together. This raised my interest into a learning a programming language alongside Javascript.

The completed project allows you to play the piano using A S F G H J & W E T Y U and setup the piano without using any images. It taught me positioning and the use of events using Javascript.
